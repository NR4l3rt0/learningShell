The meaning of especial characters must be considered properly.
Sometimes it may be useful to escape then. In any case, there
are different ways of scaping metacharacters:

  - Single quotes -> ALL special characters loose their meaning
  - Double quotes -> some metacharacters are escaped, but not
the following: $ , ` , \$ , \' , \" , \\ .
  - Backslash     -> all characters immediately after this symbol
looses its meaning
  - Backsticks    -> anything in between would be interpreted as 
a command, so it would be executed.
